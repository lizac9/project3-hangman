Deployment Heroku proccess:
1. Log in Heroku. 
2. Click in the "New" button in the top right.
3. Select "Create New App"
4. Choose a name to the App and choose a region.
5. Click in "Create App" button.
6. You must then create a Config Var called PORT. Set this to 8000.
7. When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the Settings tab. Select  "Add Buildpacks". 
8. Add Python and save, do the same for Node.js, in that order. Python must show first in the list.
The ordering is as follows:
    1. heroku/python
    2. heroku/nodejs
9. Go to Deploy in the nav bar. In Deployment Method, select GitHub/Connect to GitHub.
